## üîç How This System Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Generation
- A **PRBS (Pseudo-Random Bit Sequence Generator)** generates random bits (0s and 1s) to simulate real-world data.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Electrical Pulse Shaping
- The random bits go into an **NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) Pulse Generator**.
- This converts the bitstream into electrical pulses.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optical Modulation
- A **CW (Continuous Wave) Laser** emits an optical carrier signal.
- A **Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM)** receives:
  - Electrical pulses from NRZ
  - Optical signal from CW Laser  
- The MZM modulates the light based on the data ‚Üí optical signal is created.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transmission Through Fiber
- The optical signal travels through **100 km optical fiber**.
- Signal suffers from:
  - **Dispersion** (pulse broadening)
  - **Attenuation** (power loss)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reception and Filtering
- A **PIN Photodetector** converts the received optical signal back into an electrical signal.
- A **Low Pass Filter (LPF)** removes high-frequency noise to clean the output.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Analysis
- **BER Analyzer** compares sent vs. received bits to find the **Bit Error Rate**.
- **Eye Diagram Analyzer** shows signal quality visually.

## üìà Q-Factor & Eye Diagram Explanation

### What is Q-Factor?
- The **Q-Factor** is a measure of signal quality.
- Higher Q means lower bit error rate and better signal clarity.

**Example:**  
If **Q = 8**, it means:
- Signal quality is **good**
- **Eye opening is wide**, indicating minimal distortion

### How to Improve Q-Factor:
- Increase **transmitted power** of the laser
- Use **shorter fiber** or add **optical amplifiers**
- Use **Dispersion Compensation Fiber (DCF)** to reduce pulse spreading
- Choose better **filter bandwidth** to remove noise
- Adjust **bias voltage** and **extinction ratio** of MZM for better modulation
